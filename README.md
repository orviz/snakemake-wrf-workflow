# Snakemake WRF Workflow

This repository contains a Snakemake workflow to run a WPS/WRF simulation.

The main workflow is defined in `Snakefile`. It reads `config/config.yaml`, where
the run years, ERA5 domain, input/output directories, WPS/WRF installation paths,
template namelists, and table names are configured. The Snakefile uses those
values to build the WPS and WRF steps: namelist generation, geogrid, ERA5
download, ungrib, metgrid, real, and wrf.

## Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` before running the workflow. The most important values
are:

- `runs`: years to simulate.
- `grib_basedir`: directory where ERA5 GRIB files are stored.
- `run_dir`: per-year WRF run directory template.
- `wps_install_dir` and `wrf_install_dir`: WPS and WRF installation directories.
- `geog_data_path`: WPS geographical data directory.
- `era5_domain`: ERA5 domain name.
- `geo_em_path`: directory for geogrid outputs.
- `namelist_wps` and `namelist_input`: Jinja2 namelist templates.

## Examples

There are two example configurations in the repository. The current `Snakefile`
is intended to be used with the `toy_example` templates in
`config/templates/toy_example/`. This example runs a light WRF simulation over
only a few days.

The ERA5 helper `ERA5/retrieve_era5_days4_6.py` was created for the toy example
to reduce the workflow runtime by downloading only the required days.

## Workflow Execution

This project uses Pixi to manage its environment and execute workflows via automated tasks.

### 1. Running Locally

To validate the workflow structure or run small test domains on your local machine:

```bash
# Dry run to preview the execution plan
pixi run dry-run

# Execute locally using all available cores
pixi run run-local
```

*Note: If you need to append extra Snakemake arguments, like targeting a specific rule or requesting a fixed number of cores, you can pass them directly at the end of the command, for example: `pixi run run-local --cores 4`*

### 2. Running on HPC

HPC cluster configurations and Slurm scheduler flags are decoupled from the scientific code using *Git Worktrees* to ensure project portability.

- **Step 2.1: Embed the HPC profile**

Initialize the cluster infrastructure `hpc-profiles` branch into your local profiles directory. For instance, adding Altamira cluster profile configuration will be done through:

```bash
git worktree add config/profiles hpc-profiles
```

The command above will populate `config/profiles/` with the available cluster configurations (e.g., `altamira/`), each containing its own Slurm presets and a `set_env.sh` file.

- **Step 2.2: Launch the Simulation**

To execute the workflow, use the unifed Pixi's `hpc-profile` task. **Pass the name of the HPC profile as the first argument**, followed by any optional Snakemake flags:

```bash
# Standard execution on Altamira
pixi run hpc-profile altamira

# Dry-run execution on Altamira
pixi run hpc-profile altamira --dry-run

# Execution limiting concurrent Slurm jobs
pixi run hpc-profile altamira --jobs 15
```

*Note: As described in the local execution section, any extra Snakemake argument is passed directly to the pixi task. However, Slurm-related settings are defined through the profile configuration under `profiles/<profile>/config.yaml`*

*Note: For cluster-specific validations (like checking NetCDF paths via ldd on Altamira), please refer to the internal documentation at `config/profiles/<profile>/README.md` after mounting the worktree.*

### 3. Working with HPC profiles (Git Worktree)

Once the Git Worktree is set up, any update in the configuration of any HPC profile will work as follows:

- **Download configuration updates**:

```bash
cd config/profiles/altamira
git pull origin hpc-profiles
```

- **Upload configuration changes**:

```bash
cd config/profiles/altamira
# E.g. modify config.yaml...
git add config.yaml
git commit -m "Increase memory limits for WRF simulation"
git push origin hpc-profiles
```

## DAG

The workflow DAG is shown below. The repository also includes the PDF version in
`dag.pdf`.

![Workflow DAG](dag.png)

Regenerate it with:

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag.png
```

## TODO

- Decide how to protect the workflow from missing control files due to storage
  problems such as partition unmounts.
- Create a Snakefile to run CORDEX in Altamira. The main difference is that the
  domain is provided as an argument.
- Decide which symbolic links are created by default and which are provided by
  the user. For example, `GEOGRID.TBL` and `METGRID.TBL` are provided by the
  user, but `Vtable` is created by default. The user can provide a custom
  `Vtable` if desired.
- Download `geog_data_path` from
  https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/site/access_code/geog_data.html if it is not
  available.
- Improve `ERA5/retrieve_era5.py` to support days as an argument. Decide how to
  handle this in the Snakefile.
- Ask Josipa if it would be possible to clean the WRF/run template folder.
  Decide how to deal with the excludes:
  `/gpfs/projects/meteo/WORK/ASNA/projects/cordex-core/02_SAM12_evaluation/rundir/WRFv4.6.1-cordex_core/run/`.
